# POS-Tagging-NLTK

Parts-of-speech tagging or POS-Tagging means classifying words into their parts of speech and lableling them accordingly.

Here, nltk libray is used to tag a given document, namely 'corpus.txt', which contains a sample paragraph.
NLTK provides several taggers. In this case, DefaultTagger(), UnigramTagger(), and BigramTagger() have been used.

Three text files have been generaed in the output folder along with the tagged texts that are previously in the 'corpus.text'
